    "# LOAD DATA from ANES 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code loads the ANES 2016 database, structured as follows:\n",
    "- Each column corresponds to one question of the survey (including things like mode of interview, demographic data...), codified with a string mixing letters and numbers.\n",
    "- Each row corresponds to one person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about which question is represented by each code is given in the \"anes_timeseries_2016_guidebook.pdf\", which can be found in data/anes_timeseries_2016/ folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding method is a bit of a mess but there are some general ideas:\n",
    "- The survey is taken both before and after the election, but questions are not necessarily the same. Pre-election questions start with \"V161...\", and post-election ones, with \"V162...\". Codes beginning with \"V160...\" correspond to technical information.\n",
    "- When there are multiple possible answers in a question (religious identification, race...) each answer is usually codified as different by adding a letter to the code. For example, V161310 indicate self-identified race, and the answers are codified by V161310a: white; V161310b: black...\n",
    "- In those cases, results are aggregated in a final code which includes the letter 'x' at the end. In the former case, V161310x includes all possible races.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of special importance for our work are the questions about being in favor/opposite of certain policies. ANES has a singular way of making this kind of questions: First, it asks the respondant if he/she is in favor or against the policy. Then, it asks how much in favor or against it (the same code as the former question but adding a letter), and finally, they sumarize the results (the same code as before but with a letter x). For example, in the case of Building a wall with Mexico, first it is asked \"Do you favor, oppose, or neither favor nos oppose building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico?\" (code V161196). Then, it is asked \"Do you favor/oppose that \\[a great deal, a moderate amount, a little\\]?\" (code V161196a). Finally, the summary is shown in code V161196x."

    "### A brief comment about representativity of surveys, just in case\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though ANES (and pretty much any other survey) tries to take a representative sample of the whole american society, there are always some variations that make some demographic groups either over or underrepresented. For example, if black women between 18 and 35 years old with income between 20K-30K dollars represent 10% of american society, but only 8% of the ANES sample, then one must give more importance to their answers with respect to the rest of the sample so that the final results of the survey are truly representative of the american society. This process of weighting data is as complicated as it seems, but most surveys perform this treatment themselves and include it in the data in the form of weights for each individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ANES case, this information is codified in columns V160101 for the pre-election survey, and V160102 for the post-election one (Note that the sample varies a little between surveys, so the weights also change). There are more weights, but we are only interested in those two. Its application is straightforward: when computing histograms (or any other treatment), the answer of a given individual must be multiplied by his/her weight."

    "# About format in the answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, sociologists don't usually work with Python, but use other specific software. As a result, they are not very categorical with their data, meaning that the response format can vary from integers to floats and worst of all, strings. Therefore, before trying to work with the data one must usually convert all of those into integers or floats (when aplicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code extracts **some** of the relevant questions of the previous list into a new database (\"df_data\"), including the weights, and curates the data so that categorical responses are given as integers from 1 onwards, with the function \"data_processor\". We could maybe avoid this step, but then comparison between real-world and synthetic distributions might become very complicated. Note that answers in string format usually include the integer that correspond to each answer as the first digit of the string (e.g. \"1. Favor a great deal\" the construction of a will with Mexico).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: ANES is relatively consistent in that \"1\" usually means greatly in favor, but some questions have different kinds of answers (e.g. V161228x: Transgender policy, in which respondant chooses between \"gender born\" or \"gender identified\" instead of \"favor\" or \"oppose\"). Nevertheless, even when the questions have \"favor/oppose\" answers, responses can be easily misinterpreted. Take, for example, the issues \"Wall with Mexico\" (V161196x) and \"Birthright citizenship\" (V161193x). In those cases, \"1\" has the meaning \"In favor of constructing a wall with Mexico\" (leaning republican), but also \"Favor birthright citizenship\" (leaning democrat). This will become very relevant when we try to compare real opinion distributions with synthetic ones, and will probably need some further data curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations: if a response is not given, then a '0' is assigned. Some responses have negative numbers (e.g. \"-8. Don't know\", \"-9. refused to answer\"...), and those are also assigned a '0'. Finally, it is assumed that only integers below 9 are used. This is true for most questions, as there are usually no more than 8 answers, but not in all of them. Maybe the most representative cases are the \"feeling thermometer\" from 0 to 100 (V161086 to V161096, and V162078 to V162113). Regardless, none of the questions included in the former list incur in this problem."
